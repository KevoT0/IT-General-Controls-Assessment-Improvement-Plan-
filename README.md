**Project for NovaCore Microfinance Bank**

---

## üè¢ Organization Overview

- **Name:** NovaCore Microfinance Bank  
- **Industry:** Financial Services  
- **Size:** ~350 employees

## üìå Business Situation

NovaCore recently failed a preliminary audit by a potential investor and was flagged by the central bank due to IT control weaknesses. There is an urgent need to improve IT General Controls (ITGC) across:

- Access Management  
- Change Management  
- Backup & Recovery  
- System Logging & Monitoring  

The Board has approved an ITGC remediation project with a 3-month timeline. As the Internal IT Risk Consultant, the task is to conduct a full ITGC assessment and develop an actionable improvement plan.
